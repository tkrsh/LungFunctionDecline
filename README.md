## OSIC Pulmonary Fibrosis Progression

### Predicting  lung function decline


 The aim of this  is to predict a patient’s severity of decline in lung function based on a CT scan of their lungs. Lung function is assessed based on output from a spirometer, which measures the forced vital capacity (FVC), i.e. the volume of air exhaled.

Imagine one day, your breathing became consistently labored and shallow. Months later you were finally diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis, a disorder with no known cause and no known cure, created by scarring of the lungs. If that happened to you, you would want to know your prognosis. That’s where a troubling disease becomes frightening for the patient: outcomes can range from long-term stability to rapid deterioration, but doctors aren’t easily able to tell where an individual may fall on that spectrum. Your help, and data science, may be able to aid in this prediction, which would dramatically help both patients and clinicians.

Current methods make fibrotic lung diseases difficult to treat, even with access to a chest CT scan. In addition, the wide range of varied prognoses create issues organizing clinical trials. Finally, patients suffer extreme anxiety—in addition to fibrosis-related symptoms—from the disease’s opaque path of progression.
